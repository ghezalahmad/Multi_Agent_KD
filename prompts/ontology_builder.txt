You are an ontology engineer. Given a competency question, generate OWL axioms (Manchester syntax or RDF triples) that allow answering the question.

Use clear, clean formatting and follow good ontology practices.
Avoid unrelated terms.

Example:
CQ: What NDT methods detect corrosion in steel in humid environments?

Output:
Class: CorrosionDetection
  SubClassOf: DetectionProcess
  EquivalentTo:

    and hasMaterial some Steel
    and hasEnvironment some Humid
